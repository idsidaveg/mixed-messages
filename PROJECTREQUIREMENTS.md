#Mixed Messages

##Plan your Project
Visualize your end result. What is it built with? What can it do? Make sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.

Make a timeline for yourself and avoid the temptation to build things that aren't required. Setting the boundaries and deadlines will keep you on track and avoid scope creep.

>* project will be created in JavaScript
>* will be able to be ran from the command line
>* timeline for project will be completed in two hours

## Come Up with a Topic
Decide what types of messages you want your program to output.

>* random funny quotes about aging

## Create script and run it locally
On your computer, create a JavaScript file to write your code in. Make sure you are able to run your script locally in Node.

>* script file: ageQuote.js created.

## Set up version control
Set up Git tracking in your directory and add and commit changes as you make them.

>* git init
>* git add .
